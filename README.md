**Clockwise** is an open-source smart wall clock that you can easily build yourself.  
It only needs:

- 64x64 RGB LED Matrix (HUB75 or HUB75E)
- ESP32 dev board
- 5V 3A power supply
- Jumpers

To simplify assembly, you can also use the [**WiseShield-32 DIY PCB kit**](https://www.elecrow.com/clockwise-diy-kit.html) â€” created in partnership with Elecrow especially for Clockwise.

---

## Features

- Real-time clock with customizable themes ("Clockfaces")
- Web-based interface for configuration
- Open-source hardware and firmware
- Compatible with various PCBs or just simple wiring
- Community-driven

## Quick Start

### 1. Required Hardware

If you want to build it from scratch, you will need at least these components below. Follow the instructions on [Wiki]() to assemble it. 
- 64x64 RGB LED matrix (HUB75 or HUB75E)
- ESP32 Dev Board
- 5V 3A power supply
- Jumpers

Alternatively, we created a custom PCB that simplifies this process a lot. The kit includes not only the PCB but all components including sensors to make your clock smarter. Check the [WiseShield-32 PCB kit](https://www.elecrow.com/clockwise-diy-kit.html) out now!

### 2. Flash Firmware

- Go to: [https://clockwise.page](https://clockwise.page)
- Follow the on-screen steps to flash Clockwise and configure WiFi

## How to Build

You can assemble Clockwise in three different ways:

1. **Web Flashing** â€” the easiest way (recommended)  
    ðŸ‘‰ [Wiki: Web Flashing Guide](https://github.com/jnthas/clockwise/wiki/Flashing-Clockwise)

2. **PlatformIO** â€” advanced usage for developers  
    ðŸ‘‰ [Wiki: Building with PlatformIO](https://github.com/jnthas/clockwise/wiki/Building-with-PlatformIO)

3. **ESP-IDF** â€” for full control  
    ðŸ‘‰ [Wiki: Building with ESP-IDF](https://github.com/jnthas/clockwise/wiki/Building-with-ESP-IDF)

## Advanced Configuration

Clockwise offers a flexible set of options that you can adjust through its built-in Settings page:

* **WiFi settings** â€” easily update your network details without reflashing
* **Timezone & NTP server** â€” sync the clock accurately for your region
* **Display brightness** â€” manual or automatic control (with optional LDR sensor)
* **Display rotation** â€” adjust orientation to match your wall setup
* **Clockface selection** â€” switch between installed Clockfaces or use Canvas themes
* **RGB order correction** â€” fix color mismatch on certain LED matrices
* **POSIX timezone string** â€” fine-tune timezone behavior
